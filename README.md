# WT-Plotter

WT-Plotter is a lightweight application designed to parse and display information from War Thunder replay files, including older versions. Special thanks to [FlareFlo](https://github.com/FlareFlo) for his  [wt_ext_cli](https://github.com/Warthunder-Open-Source-Foundation/wt_ext_cli) project, as well as Klensy and Kotiq for their work on replay file parsing.

**Note:** This project is still under active development. Some features may be incomplete or contain bugs. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Technical Insights

WT-Plotter currently extracts basic information from replay files. Advanced data, such as player positions, remains in an undecoded format. All parsed data is stored locally in the `wtplotter` folder within your documents directory:

- **Database:** A SQLite database stores replay data. Avoid modifying its structure to prevent compatibility issues.
- **Exported Maps:** Maps are saved in the same directory as the database by default.
- **Position Tracking:** Player positions are fetched using War Thunder's localhost:8111 API. This method is safe and does not risk account bans.
